This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown. I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/)- it’ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## **Here is a secondary heading**

Here’s a useless table:

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here’s a code chunk:

    var foo = function(x) {
      return(x + 5);
    }
    foo(3)

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

    var foo = function(x) {
      return(x + 5);
    }
    foo(3)

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    var foo = function(x) {
      return(x + 5);
    }
    foo(3)

**Boxes**

You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### **Notification**

**Note:** This is a notification box.

**Warning**

**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### **Error**

**Error:** This is an error box.
